# H1 BASH Settings

I am new to this but have found it useful to make these available.  They are pretty tailored to me and my computer, mostly because I dont know yet how to fix it all.  If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.

# H2 How to Use

1. Fork this repo
2. From your home directory, ```git clone <YOUR FORK>```
3. Add to your ```.bashrc``` or ```.bash_profile```:
  * ```source /Users/<USER PROFILE>/bash/.bash_start```
4. Restart your terminal

# H2 What does it do

* Git, will show your current branch and it's status at the end of the prompt
* Virtual Environments, will show at the beginning of the prompt
* UnRar, Setup for it (probably very specific to my machine)
* Docker, Setup for it
* Functions:
  1. title - will take the passed string and set the title of the tab to it
    ```title I want a Pony!!!```
